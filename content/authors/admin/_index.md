I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning in Psychiatry group of Prof Dr Tim Hahn at the Institute of Translational Psychiatry, 
Münster. I'm working on the application of machine learning algorithms to neuroimaging data of psychiatric patients to 
build better predictive models in a clinical context.
